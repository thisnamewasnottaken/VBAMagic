Same applies for hotfixes, though in much shorter timeframe as the work there tends to be urgent.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding what has changed from one version to another ( as you can imagine) is very important. We usually would export the release notes, at the moment using the _search_, as we want to include more information than just issue_id and description.\r\n\r\nWhat would make our life even easier is\r\n * to gain more insights into the progress of the release. e.g. visual progress of the epic on how much of the work is yet to be completed\r\n * to allow more flexible Release Notes template as the current one is very limiting\r\n * to be able to visualize the work on our board grouped by version\/release. Similar to what the next-gen has for epic and assignee.\r\n * to be able to filter by release(s) on Backlog and Roadmap pages. On the Roadmap one also by\u00a0_Released_ ones\r\n * to be able to see which release an issue\/bug\/story etc belongs to on the backlog page. Similar to how story points at the moment are visualized on each issue\r\n * to be able to add more \"release\" fields for a single issue type. For our internal KPIs we would like to be able to track when an issue was actually introduced. Currently this is possible on the old Jira projects\r\n * ...and more but need to think about it :)\r\n\r\nDeployment and in general rollout is not part of releasing. That is a completely separate beast that needs tackling.\r\n\r\nAs far as who can create releases, it would be Members of a team\/product and Administrators.","Comment.82":"12\/Jun\/2019 1:25 PM;christine.blower;Hi Nathan\r\n\r\nHere's what we use releases for and why they are so important to us:\r\n * Why you need releases and\/or version in your next-gen projects\r\n ** Version control is critical for our business.\u00a0 We release often and need to ensure that we are aware what version things are fixed in so that we can inform our clients.\u00a0\r\n ** Some clients are on different versions, as they are unable to take the latest releases due to lack of testing resource on their side.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n * How your team uses these features in classic projects\r\n ** When a feature has passed testing, we assign it to a Ready for Live status, and assign it to the version.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n ** While doing design work we create a separate branch to ensure that we can still develop on the main version, but have a new version in the background - being able to set versions means that we know which version of the software we are testing\r\n ** When setting a version in classic - the version number shows in the backlog - very handy\r\n\r\n * how releases and\/or versions fits into your team\u2019s process\r\n ** We have setup 4 states in our project - To Do, Doing, Ready for LIVE & Done\r\n ** As part of our definition of done we assign the version when the Jira is Ready for LIVE\r\n ** We go live biweekly\r\n * who\u2019s involved in creating and releasing versions\r\n ** Administrators of the project\r\n\r\nWe really want to move to NextGen, but without this we would be unable to do.\u00a0\u00a0","Comment.83":"18\/Jun\/2019 5:23 AM;risto.saari;we have the same : We really want to move to NextGen, but without this we would be unable to do.","Comment.84":"18\/Jun\/2019 3:55 PM;sergio420345757;This is a basic function needed for us... we won\u00b4t move to nextgen unless we have this","Comment.85":"18\/Jun\/2019 4:59 PM;eric1315782350;We have moved to NextGen Jira for some new small team projects, for most other things that is working out well and it lets the team more easily manage their project, but it has made the job of recording and documenting what is in a release much more difficult.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEven with the Releases feature on old gen projects, one thing that was a pain was when a release included work from more than one project.

I understand that is frustrating for users that need this right now, but we are looking into this and are aware it is a top voted ticket.\r\n\r\nThis is currently not in the roadmap, as we are still defining the scope of work and how we can break it down into deliverables.

If we have just a Jira column representing Done (as in code complete) and then an extra column representing deployed, there is no way to see during which release\/deployment those tickets were made available to the public. Whether people organise these groupings in advance or during the release process itself, it's valuable to know what was deployed and when and this is a fundamental part of making software that the boards don't easily cover on their own.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFundamentally, what my team needs, is a way to select a group of tickets, and press a button that says \"please group these together, mark them as released\/deployed on datetime X, and hide them from the board\"","Comment.103":"02\/Jul\/2019 7:44 AM;bs75;Excellent phrased Mitch. The grouping together of tickets for future reference is more important to us than planning a release schedule.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have ideas for what part of the release process should be handled by Jira compared to some of the other products, specifically Bitbucket and Bamboo. And how should these products ideally interact?
