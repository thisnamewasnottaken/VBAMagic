# VBAMagic

VBA Magic is my baby repository of VBA shortcuts and routines I find useful. 
Some are my original work, others were adapted from sources or just even plain copies from forums.

## Support & Discuss
There is no place to go and discuss this repository, but feel free to change anything you need to!

## Installation and Notes
Manually add code to modules in your VBA. 
If you don't know how to do this, and can't understand the code, **please don't use this**.

##Issues##

"Now, in Russia, they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else... that's the theory, anyway. 
But what I know about is Texas, an' down here... you're on your own."

##Feature requests##

"Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment where you feel free to fail."
